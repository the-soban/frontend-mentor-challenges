# **Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution**


Here's my solution for the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges are helping me improve my front-end skills by building interactive projects and chellenges.

## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup for clean structure.
- Mobile-first workflow for Responsive Design.
- CSS custom properties, Flexbox for consistent layout.
- Github for Code Management.
- Netlify to host the Live Site.


### What I learned:

While working with HTML and Custom CSS Properties, I learned the Mobile-First approach for developing a responsive webpage.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px){
      html{
        font-size: 24px;
    }
}
```

### Useful resources:

- [TypeScale](https://typescale.com/) - This helped me for understanding font scales. It has a font scale calculator for converting px to em/rem. Highly recommend this for making consistent fonts.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) - This documentation helped me understand CSS Media Queries.
